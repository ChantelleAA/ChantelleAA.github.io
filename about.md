About Me
Hi! I’m Chantelle Amoako-Atta, a machine learning enthusiast and data scientist passionate about finding innovative solutions to complex problems. With a strong background in data-centric engineering and mathematical sciences, I've had the pleasure of working on projects ranging from medical image segmentation to forecasting energy consumption using deep learning models.

My journey began with a love for mathematics, which soon evolved into an exploration of its application in AI and data science. I believe in the power of data to transform industries, and I'm driven by a curiosity to improve diagnostic tools in healthcare and beyond.

I have experience working with Python, TensorFlow, and CUDA for GPU computing, and my recent work includes developing user-centric systems using Django and applying machine learning algorithms to classify cardiac arrhythmias.

Looking forward, I aim to deepen my expertise in AI and contribute to impactful projects that make a difference in people’s lives. When I'm not coding or researching, you can find me enjoying a strategic game of Oware or exploring nature trails.

Thanks for stopping by—I hope you enjoy exploring my blog and projects!
